cURL to Code Converter
A simple, single-file web utility to deconstruct cURL commands and instantly generate equivalent code snippets in various programming languages. Built with vanilla JavaScript and styled with Tailwind CSS, this tool is designed for developers who frequently work with APIs and need a quick way to translate cURL commands into usable code.

‚ú® Features
Instant cURL Parsing: Automatically breaks down any cURL command into its core components:

URL

Request Method (GET, POST, etc.)

Headers

Request Body

Multi-Language Code Generation: Convert cURL commands into ready-to-use code snippets for:

JavaScript (with fetch API)

Python (with the requests library)

PHP (with its native cURL extension)

Go (with the net/http package)

Rust (with the reqwest crate)

Sleek & Responsive UI: A clean, dark-themed interface built with Tailwind CSS that works beautifully on all screen sizes.

Simple "Copy" Functionality:

Copy individual parsed parts (URL, body, etc.) with a single click.

Copy the entire generated code snippet.

A "Copy All" button to get all parsed details at once.

Zero Dependencies: A self-contained index.html file. No builds, no npm install, no fuss. Just open the file in your browser.

Smart Body Formatting: Automatically pretty-prints JSON bodies for better readability.

üöÄ How to Use
